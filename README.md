A universal? (potentially) language learning App <br>
First, geared towards learning Cantonese <br>
Developed using Android, hopefully can add iPhone support later without too much fuss <br>
Built using these instructions: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html under the 'Building Projects With Native Code' tab
